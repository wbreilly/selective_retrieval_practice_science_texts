2, Viruses can invade and reproduce inside any living cells  ,1,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
3, Biologists consider viruses to be non-living ,2,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
4, Viruses are not cells ,2,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
5, Viruses do not use energy to grow ,3,RP-,RP+,NRP,1,0,1
6, Viruses do not respond to their surroundings ,3,RP-,RP+,NRP,1,0,1
7," Viruses cannot make food, ",4,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
8, Viruses cannot take in food,4,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
9, Viruses cannot produce waste ,4,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
10,"The only way in which viruses are like organisms is that they can multiply, ",5,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
11, but they do so differently ,5,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
12, Viruses can only multiply when they are inside a living cell ,6,RP+,RP-,NRP,1,1,0
13,Viruses infect host cells,7,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
14,Host cells are infected so that the virus can multiply,7,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
15,All viruses have two basic parts: ,8,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
16,a protein coat,8,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
17,the protein coat protects the virus,8,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
18, and an inner core,8,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
19,the inner core is made of genetic material ,8,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
20, A virus’s genetic material contains the instructions for making new viruses,9,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
21, The proteins on the surface of a virus play an important role ,10,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
22, during the invasion of a host cell ,10,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
23, Each virus contains unique surface proteins ,11,RP+,RP-,NRP,1,1,0
24, the surface proteins look like the proteins that the host cell normally needs ,11,RP+,RP-,NRP,1,1,0
25, The virus attaches itself to special sites on the host ,12,RP-,RP+,NRP,1,0,1
26,the host has special sites reserved for the virus's surface proteins ,12,RP-,RP+,NRP,1,0,1
27," Like keys, a virus’s proteins fit only into certain “locks,”  or proteins on the surface of a host cell ",13,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
28," Because the lock-and-key action of a virus is specific, ",14,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
29, a certain virus can attach only to one or a few types of cells  ,14,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
30,"Once a virus attaches to the surface of a host cell, ",15,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
31, it injects its genetic material into the cell ,15,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
32, The virus’s inner core takes over the cell functions ,16,RP+,RP-,NRP,1,1,0
33, and the cell starts to produce the virus’s proteins ,16,RP+,RP-,NRP,1,1,0
34, and genetic material ,16,RP+,RP-,NRP,1,1,0
35," In turn, these two parts assemble into new viruses ",17,RP-,RP+,NRP,1,0,1
36, new viruses fill the cell ,17,RP-,RP+,NRP,1,0,1
37," When it is full of new viruses, the host cell bursts open and dies ",18,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
38, as it releases hundreds of new viruses ,18,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
39, to infect other cells ,18,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
40, and the process starts over again ,18,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
41,"Despite their tiny size, ",19,RP+,RP-,NRP,1,1,0
42,﻿ viruses have the ability to cause a lot of damage to cells of other organisms ,19,RP+,RP-,NRP,1,1,0
43, All living things are capable of being infected by viruses ,20,RP-,RP-,NRP,0,0,0
44, One of the best studied viruses infects bacteria ,21,RP-,RP+,NRP,1,0,1
45," It is called a bacteriophage, ",22,RP-,RP+,NRP,1,0,1
46, which means bacteria-eater ,22,RP-,RP+,NRP,1,0,1
